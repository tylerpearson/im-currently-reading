I'm Currently Reading
=====================

This is an weekend project app I put together to share books that you are currently reading. Ideally the Amazon link would have an affiliate tag, but that isn't allowed in North Carolina.

The app is built on Ruby on Rails and uses the Amazon Product Advertising API for book information and images.

The server setup uses looks like: Digital Ocean SSD/Ubuntu 12.04 x64/nginx/PostgreSQL/Unicorn/Capistrano.
